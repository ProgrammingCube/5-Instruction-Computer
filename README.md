# Python 5 Instruction Computer
A python implementation of the [WDR paper computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDR_paper_computer)

## Introduction
This project is meant to help coders understand just _what_ assembly language is, and just _what_ the CPU is doing under the hood.

With only 5 instructions, this "CPU" implementation is certainly simple. But because it includes a branching jump, it is, in fact, [turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness).

## Instructions

1. [inc](#incdescriptor)
1. [dec](#incdescriptor)
1. [isz](#incdescriptor)
1. [jmp](#incdescriptor)
1. [stp](#incdescriptor)
